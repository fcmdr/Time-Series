We study the number of passengers per month (in thousands) in air transport, from 1949 to 1960. This time series is available on R (\texttt{AirPassengers}).

```{r, out.width="70%"}
data("AirPassengers")
plot(AirPassengers)
plot(diff(AirPassengers,lag = 12,differences = 1))
```

It seems that there is still a slightly growing trend...

Let's apply differencing once again
```{r, out.width="70%"}
seriediff=diff(diff(AirPassengers,lag = 12))
plot(seriediff)
```

It seems visually stationary...

We can have a look to the correlogram and 
```{r, out.width="70%"}
acf(seriediff)
```

and test if the residual series is a white noise
```{r}
Box.test(seriediff,lag=10,type="Ljung-Box")$p.value
```
This is not the case: there is some autocorrelations to modelize...
